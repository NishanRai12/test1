          <p>Gregor Samsa awaken one morning to find himself 
            transformed or metamorphosed into a vicious giant vermin and his greatest worry is that he gets to 
            work on time.The story has central existentialist theme of the story is Work, capitalism, drudgery, angst 
            and alienation mostly takes place in a single confined room. The opening lines of the book is one of the 
            greatest literature in the world “ AS GREGOR SAMSA AWOKE ONE MORNING FROM UNEASY DREAMS 
            HE FOUND HIMSELF TRANSFORMED IN HIS BED INTO A MONSTROUS VERMIN” The cause of

            There is a big detachement between the human mind and
            the metamorphosed body of Gregor’s. He tries to reconcile his human emotions and with 
            physical urges of this body. This details still shows that he still feels connected to his past self and he 
            considered himself as a part of the family. One of the central theme that dominates every part of the 
            story is if Gregor is still human and if so to what extent. Towards the end his sister starts to think of him 
            as a lowly insect who is just a chore and inconvenience. Only the mother calls him as an unfortunate son 
            and despite the appearance of his she still think of him as an old version of him. He can hear his sister 
            playing violin and he is entranced by the violin. Was he an animal if music could captivate him so?
            The book made a clear 
            impression that why do people continue to love the loved ones even 
            after their death but not when they are metamorphosed into a vermin. Kafka has written this story in 
            such a way that reader is not terrified by thought of turning into an insect but instead to be treated by 
            the way how Gregor’s parents inhumanly treated him as if he is nothing more than just a burden The 
            lingering thought that often is that he is afraid of dying because he hasn’t yet lived his life to the fullest and same goes for us we are the gregor samsa of our own universe who lost their hope and who lost their identity who felt like an insect among own family disgusting and  misunderstood .
